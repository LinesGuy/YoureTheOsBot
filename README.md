# YoureTheOsBot

A bot for the game You're the OS

https://plbrault.github.io/youre-the-os/

This bot was designed only to be run on my own machine, with the game running in microsoft edge, windowed mode with the bookmarks tab shown on a 1920x1080 display. Screen coordinates are hard coded so if the game is even slightly offset from how it looks on my machine, the bot will probably miss many clicks. No support will be given if the bot doesn't work on your machine /shrug
